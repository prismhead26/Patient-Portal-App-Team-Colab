# Overview

## The Challenge:
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

## User Story

```md
AS a person who 
I WANT to be able 
SO THAT I can 
And to be able to
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```
## Application Info:

## Installation Instructions:
Step 1: Clone repository.
<br>
Step 2: Install Nodejs.
<br>
Step 3: Install a source-code editor like VsCode.
<br>
Step 4: Nodemon is recommended in order to refresh and see updated notes data.

## Usage Instructions
Step 1: In order to run the application locally, MySQL must be installed.
<br>
Step 2: Connect to the server using MySQL in the same directory as the code.
<br>
Step 3: Source the Schema and Seeds files for the database.
<br>
Step 4: Open VsCode(preferred) or another source-code editor if not already running.
<br>
Step 5: Open integrated terminal once in the main folder.
<br>
Step 6: "run npm i" / "sudo npm i" in the terminal to install the required dependencies.
<br>
Step 7: Now to run the application, Enter "nodemon index.js" or "npm start" and "node index.js" if you don't have npm nodemon.
<br>
Step 8: After the "Connection Successful!" appears in the console, the application will proceed to the next stage.



## Test Instructions:
For testing and debugging, the application logs requests and errors in the console. DBeaver, a client software application and a database administration tool, is also recommended to view the database and see it "visually."
